# WordPuzzle
In the word puzzle project there are different levels.
Each level has jumbled words at the bottom and the grid above the jumbled letters will be dynamically created according to the number of words.
Grid can be filled with meaningful words when the user tries to make words by joining letters at the bottom.
Once the grid is filled with meaningful words, the level is complete and will go to next level and as the level is cleared the difficulty rises(currently there are 5 levels).
